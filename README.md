# RSA Factoring Challenge

## Description
> Prime numbers can be used to encrypt documents for security reasons. That makes prime factorization significant for this reason. The goal is to factorize these numbers as fast as possible before the target fixes this bug on their server - so that we can decode the encrypted documents.

## Requirements

### General
- You can choose the language of your choice.
- OS needs to be Standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS/

## Scripts
0. **factors** - Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.
    * Usage: `factors <file>`
<br>

1. **rsa** - RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number `n`, there exist prime numbers `p` and `q` such that `n = p Ã— q`. The problem is to find these two primes, given only `n`.
<br>

**NOTE**: the **rsa_python** file can also be used to solve problem 1. It is used mainly as an indication that the factoring problem can consume a lot of computing resources.
